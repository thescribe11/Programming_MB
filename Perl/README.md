## Changes:

Added input validation to fix the bug where non-numerical values are evaluated as the scalar value 0.

## How to run:

1. Open your terminal.
2. `cd` to the directory holding the scripts.
3. `~/$ perl <script>`. This works on Linux without having to install anything; since you have a Mac, it might be different.
