## Source Project:

Raschio Office Word 2019, v.4. This is a text editing program I made a while back.

## Changes:

Got rid of unused imports, made the code PEP-8 compliant, and added printing support for Linux.

## How to Run:

On Linux: `~/$ python3 <script>`

On Mac: ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯. I'm pretty sure you run it like on Linux, but don't quote me on this.

On Windows: First, [Install Python.](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/) Once you've done that, access your terminal and type `python <script>`.
